COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

            This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for analyzing and visualizing global COVID-19 data, with a focus on key metrics for selected countries.

Project Description

      This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on a COVID-19 dataset to understand trends in cases and deaths over time and to visualize these patterns. The analysis specifically highlights data for Kenya, the United States, and India.

Objectives

            *   Load and preprocess COVID-19 data.
            *   Filter the dataset to focus on specific countries.
            *   Handle missing data to ensure data quality for analysis.
            *   Calculate relevant metrics, such as the death rate.
            *   Generate visualizations (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps) to explore trends and relationships in the data.
            *   Provide insights based on the data analysis.

Tools and Libraries Used

            *   Google Colab: The environment used to run the Python notebook.
            *   Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
            *   pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
            *   matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
            *   seaborn: For creating attractive statistical graphics.

How to Run/View the Project

            1.  Open the Notebook in Google Colab: The easiest way to access and run the notebook is by opening it directly in Google Colab.
            2.  Upload Data: You will need the `owid-covid-data.csv` file. Upload this file to your Google Colab environment using the file upload feature.
            3.  Execute Cells: Run each code cell in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. The output and visualizations will be generated within the notebook.
